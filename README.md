# Angular Starter
My extensible and modular ready starter project for Angular (2 and beyond). This project comes with some basic features of every app, such as authentication, password reset, profile editing, public page etc. In addition to following good usability practices, it implements the principles of Material Design using Angular Material and MaterializeCSS.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
